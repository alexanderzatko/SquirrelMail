Description
===========

This plugin chooses an image randomly from one of several
possible sources to display on the login page.  Both local
and remote image sources are supported, all of which may
be configured by the administrator if desired.  The image
produced by this plugin may be used to replace the default
SquirrelMail "org logo" or may be displayed in addition to
(above) it.



License

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file COPYING for details).

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 0.5 or above
  * Compatibility 2.0.10+ (unless using SquirrelMail 1.4.12+ or 1.5.2+)



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Random Login Image
    configuration files, one in the login_image directory and
    one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_login_image.php").  The one in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory will always override the one in the
    login_image directory.
