Version 1.3 - 2006/04/24
* CHANGED: MIME encoded headers are decoded before trying to match. 
  Thanks to Kosaku Nagasaka.

Version 1.2 - 2004/01/13
* CHANGED: did different examples to show that this plugin is for more
  than just x-mailer style headers.
* FIXED: plugin was not allowing you to remove ALL regexes from the option
  list. Instead, it would just keep the last set of regexes.  Thanks to Michael
  Alvarez for pointing out.
* CHANGED: removed code that was forcing a ":" at the end of each regex.  this
  was holdover from when the headers had to match the options exactly.  This
  is no longer the case. 

Version 1.1 - 2003/10/13
* FIXED: The regex for removing <br>, \n, and \r was being too greedy
  on the <br> part.  Thanks to Tom Satter for catching.

Version 1.0 - 2003/04/29
* Following (new?) squirrelmail plugin guidelines, moved bulk of code
  out of setup.php and into separate file as well as Cleaned up current, 
  and added some new support files.
* Adding code for gettext internationalization (no actual translations
  though).
* FIXED: when list had two items and first one was cleared (but crlf
  remained), ALL headers were displayed.
* CHANGED: search is now case insensitive.
* CHANGED: when adding/editing headers, all headers are checked to make
  sure they have a colon at the end.  If not, one is added for the user.
* CHANGED: formatting of options when displayed changed slightly.  Line
  about "(One Per Line)" moved down and left.

Version 0.1 - 2003/04/27
* Initial release (for beta)
* Known problems: none
