Installing the Show Headers Plugin
==================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.3 version of the Show Headers plugin.

    $ cd plugins
    $ tar -xzvf show_headers-1.3-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

    $ cd ../config/
    $ ./conf.pl

3) Log into SquirrelMail and goto 'Options', 'Display Preferences'.
There is a textbox for 'Show Headers'.  Enter each header on it's
own line.  Headers can be defined two ways:

    (1) explicit text:  for example, "User-Agent:" would only match
        the "user-agent" header.
    
    (2) regular expression: for example, "X-Habeas.*[1-5]:" would match the
        first 5 lines of the Habeas "Sender Warranted Email" headers.
        
Save your changes.

4) Read your mail ... that's all there is to it.
