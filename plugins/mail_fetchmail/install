Installing the mail_fetchmail Plugin
====================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins derictory.
Here is a example:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /usr/archives/mail_fetchmail.tar.gz

2) Then go to the fetchmail-directory and edit the config.mk file.
  $ cd mail_fetchmail/fetchmail

3) Then go to the fetchmail-directory and edit the two shell scripts to
   reflect the BINDIR and the POSTMASTER.
  
  $ cd mail_fetchmail/fetchmail

4) Then compile the program:
  $ make

5) Finally, if it compiles correctly, install it:

  $ make install

6) Look at the crontab file.  It contains a sample crontab entry which will
   run fetchmail once every 2 minutes.  Edit it as needed and install in 
   the root crontab.

7) Go to the mail_fetchmail directory
   $ cd ..

Edit the configuration options in setup.php

$mail_fetchmail_wfetch_binary : the location of the wfetch binary.
          Default is "/usr/local/sbin/wfetch"
$mail_fetchmail_buildfetchmailrc_binary : the location of the buildfetchmailrc 
					 binary.
          Default is "/usr/local/sbin/buildfetchmailrc"


6) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the mail_fetchmail plugin.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl
