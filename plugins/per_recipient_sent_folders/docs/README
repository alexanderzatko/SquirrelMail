Per Recipient Sent Folders plugin for SquirrelMail
==================================================
Version 1.0.1, 2014/02/02


Copyright (c) 2013-2014 Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>



Description
===========

This plugin helps associate recipients with the folders that
messages sent to them should be stored in.  When replying to
such a recipient, the custom sent folder selection (which is
provided by the Variable Sent Folder plugin) is defaulted to
the appropriate folder.  Recipient-to-folder associations
can be created manually on the Folder Preferences screen or
automatically by remembering what sent folder was used when
sending messages.

License (see the file COPYING for details).



Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.23 or above

  * Variable Sent Folder plugin version 1.0 or above



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Per Recipient Sent
    Folders configuration files, one in the per_recipient_sent_folders
    directory and one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_per_recipient_sent_folders.php").  The one in the main
    SquirrelMail config directory will always override the one in
    the per_recipient_sent_folders directory.



Help Requests
=============

Before looking for help elsewhere, please try to help yourself:

  * Read the Troubleshooting section herein.

  * Look to see if others have already asked about the same issue.
    There are tips and links for the best places to do this in
    the SquirrelMail mailing list posting guidelines:
    http://squirrelmail.org/wiki/MailingListPostingGuidelines
    You should also try Google or some other search engine.
  
  * If you cannot find any information about your issue, please
    first mail your help request to the squirrelmail-plugins
    mailing list.  Information about it can be found here:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-plugins
    You MUST read the mailing list posting guidelines (see above)
    and include as much information about your issue (and your
    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug
    output, the plugin configuration settings you've made and
    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.
  
  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.



TODO
====

  * Possibly useful to add a checkbox on the compose screen after
    the Variable Sent Folder drop-down that says "save" or "save
    for recipients" (which is default checked depending on the
    pref setting for auto-saving).  This way one can choose not to
    change an already associated sent folder setting for a recipient.
    Note, however, that the Variable Sent Folder already adds another
    checkbox for moving original message to same folder, so multiple
    checkboxes can be too overwhelming/messy.  Also, implementing
    this might be best done by adding another hook into the Variable
    Sent Folder plugin instead of trying to work with a complicated
    regex and relying on plugin order, etc

  * It might be nice to have the folder associations listed with
    address book entires, although adding an extra field on the
    address book page is currently very difficult
