Installing Local User Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder
======================================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.0 version of the Local User 
   Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf local_autorespond_forward-3.0-1.4.tar.gz

2) If you are using FTP functionality, go into the 
   local_autorespond_forward directory, then skip to step 5.

  $ cd local_autorespond_forward

3) Go to the suid_backend directory and configure, compile and
   install the suid backend.  In many cases, you do not need 
   to manually specify any configuration options (except 
   possibly "--enable-auth=pam" and "--enable-webuser=USER"
   (the latter only if your web server runs as some user 
   OTHER than "apache")), otherwise, please consult the README 
   file for a complete list of the available configuration 
   options.

  $ cd local_autorespond_forward/suid_backend
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su 
  # make install

   If you do need to specify any configuration options, they
   must be placed after the "./configure" command above.

   Please note that it is important that you execute "make
   install" as the root user.

4) Go back to the main local_autorespond_forward directory

  $ cd ..

5) Decide if you want to store the plugin configuration file
   in the plugin directory or in the main SquirrelMail config
   directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      copy config_example.php to config.php and edit config.php,
      making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, copy config_example.php to
      ../../config/config_local_autorespond_forward.php
      and edit ../../config/config_local_autorespond_forward.php,
      making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_local_autorespond_forward.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_local_autorespond_forward.php

6) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

7) Also, if not being used with SquirrelMail 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

8) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading Local User Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder
=====================================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.0 version of the Local User 
   Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf local_autorespond_forward-3.0-1.4.tar.gz

2) Change into the local_autorespond_forward directory, check 
   your config.php file against the new version, to see if 
   there are any new settings that you must add to your 
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided example
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 5 under the
   installation procedure above).
