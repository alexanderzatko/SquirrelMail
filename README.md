# SquirrelMail

A stack of (mostly GUI and security) patches I use for a group of Debian 9 webmail servers.

Debian sadly stopped shipping SM in their repositories. So I created my own repo for it, for convenience sake.

I try and keep this up to date to the latest Stable Snapshots from https://squirrelmail.org/download.php

Feel free to use it.


If you want to contribute to this here master (making SM more github sourced), feel free to comment/fork.
