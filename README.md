# SquirrelMail

A stack of (mostly GUI and security) patches I use for a group of Debian 9 webmail servers.

Note that the original source is written en updated mostly by Paul Lesniewski, not by me, but since Debian sadly stopped shipping SM in their repositories, I created my own here, for convenience's sake.

If you want to contribute to this here master (making SM more github sourced), feel free to use/comment/fork.

I try and keep this sync with the latest Stable Snapshots from https://squirrelmail.org/download.php and its security-related patchwork (see https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/squirrelmail ).
