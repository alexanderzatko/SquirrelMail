# SquirrelMail

This is a personal stack of (mostly GUI and security) patches I use for a group of Debian 9 webmail servers. Debian stopped shipping SM in their repositories, which is sad. So I hereby created my own repo for it, for convenience.

I generally keep this up to date to the latest Stable Snapshots from https://squirrelmail.org/download.php
Feel free to use it.
